        <h2>Top two weaknesses we must fix now</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Priority 1: we still have not proven repeatable pilot-to-paid conversion.</li>
          <li>Priority 2: budget-owner proof is still weak in live deals, so buying decisions can stall.</li>

      <h1>How we run pilots that convert to annual contracts.</h1>
      <p class="lead">A paid pilot is a short paid project on real listing workflows. We track business metrics, prove value, and convert or stop fast.</p>

        <h2>What A Paid Pilot Is</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Short, paid engagement (usually 2-6 weeks).</li>
          <li>Runs on real customer data and workflow.</li>
          <li>Has baseline metrics, weekly reviews, and a signed success plan.</li>
          <li>Ends with one decision: convert, extend once, or stop.</li>

          <li>Less rework between ops, compliance, and engineering.</li>

          <li>Conditional Extend: improvement exists but one hard blocker still open, one short extension only.</li>

          <li>Too little historical pilot data to prove repeatable conversion.</li>
          <li>Budget owner is still not confirmed early enough in some deals.</li>
          <li>Risk of being perceived as a checklist feature instead of revenue-protection workflow.</li>

        <article class="card">
          <h3>Prompt 1: Pilot Benchmarks</h3>
          <pre><code class="language-markdown">You are my research analyst for CartGuard. Find benchmark ranges for paid B2B pilots in compliance workflow software. I need typical pilot length, paid pilot pricing ranges, conversion rates from pilot to annual contract, and the strongest predictors of conversion. Output must include: metric name, value/range, date, geography, source URL, and confidence level. Use primary or highly credible sources only and clearly mark where direct data is missing.</code></pre>
        </article>

        <article class="card">
          <h3>Prompt 2: Buyer Decision Mapping</h3>
          <pre><code class="language-markdown">You are my go-to-market researcher for CartGuard. For China-based marketplace sellers entering Germany, map who signs budget for compliance tooling and who blocks deals. Output: buyer roles, decision criteria, legal/compliance concerns, procurement blockers, and what proof is required to approve paid pilots. Include source-backed evidence and explicit confidence scores.</code></pre>
        </article>

        <article class="card">
          <h3>Prompt 3: Pilot Outcome Metrics</h3>
          <pre><code class="language-markdown">You are my startup diligence researcher. Define the most credible pilot outcome metrics for EU market-entry compliance workflow tools that only flag missing documents (no legal determinations). Include baseline capture methods, metric formulas, realistic improvement targets over 30-60 days, and anti-gaming safeguards. Provide references and confidence levels for each recommendation.</code></pre>
        </article>

        <article class="card">
          <h3>Prompt 4: Objection Intelligence</h3>
          <pre><code class="language-markdown">You are my sales intelligence researcher. Identify top objections from APAC sellers evaluating EU compliance tooling and how top vendors handle them. Focus on objections around legal liability, false positives, integration effort, and ROI uncertainty. Output should include objection frequency if known, rebuttal strategy, supporting evidence, and confidence score.</code></pre>
        </article>

        <article class="card">
          <h3>Prompt 5: Expansion Triggers</h3>
          <pre><code class="language-markdown">You are my market strategy researcher. After a successful Germany pilot, what is the highest-ROI expansion path: more German categories, more EU countries, or channel expansion beyond Amazon.de? Build a ranked expansion model with assumptions, source-backed signals, risk factors, and 90-day execution suggestions. Mark every modeled estimate clearly.</code></pre>
