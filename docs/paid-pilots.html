      <h1>How we prove value before full contracts.</h1>
      <p class="lead">A paid pilot is a short paid project that proves business results with real workflow data. It is not a demo and not free trial theater.</p>
      <p class="small-note">CartGuard provides recommendations on missing documentation and evidence only. No legal advice.</p>

        <h2>What A Paid Pilot Is</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Short, paid engagement (usually 2-8 weeks).</li>
          <li>Runs on real customer data and workflow.</li>
          <li>Has baseline metrics before start and target outcomes.</li>
          <li>Ends with decision: expand, revise, or stop.</li>

          <li>Faster review cycle from draft to listing live.</li>
          <li>Less rework between ops, compliance, and engineering.</li>
          <li>Clear conversion case for annual paid contract.</li>

        <h2>Team Tasks By Role</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Engineer: integrate checks, instrument metrics, reduce false positives.</li>
          <li>Pilot lead: run cadence, unblock decisions, track commitments.</li>
          <li>Sales: map outcome to budget owner and drive conversion.</li>

        <h2>Pilot Scorecard (Go / No-Go)</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Go: measurable improvement in at least 2 core metrics and clear buyer intent to expand.</li>
          <li>No-Go: no measurable improvement, unclear owner, or only free-feature demand.</li>

        <h2>Current Weaknesses (Keep Brutal)</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Too little historical pilot data to prove repeatable conversion.</li>
          <li>Budget owner still unclear in part of our target accounts.</li>
          <li>Risk that buyers see us as a checklist feature, not a system worth paying for.</li>
          <li>Integration effort may still be too heavy for smaller teams.</li>

          <li>What exact metric moved in each active pilot and by how much?</li>
          <li>Which missing-document checks are high-value vs noise?</li>

        <article class="card">
          <h3>Prompt 1: Pilot Benchmarks</h3>
          <pre><code>You are my research analyst for CartGuard. Find benchmark ranges for paid B2B pilots in compliance workflow software. I need typical pilot length, paid pilot pricing ranges, conversion rates from pilot to annual contract, and the strongest predictors of conversion. Output must include: metric name, value/range, date, geography, source URL, and confidence level. Use primary or highly credible sources only and clearly mark where direct data is missing.</code></pre>
        </article>

        <article class="card">
          <h3>Prompt 2: Buyer Decision Mapping</h3>
          <pre><code>You are my go-to-market researcher for CartGuard. For China-based marketplace sellers entering Germany, map who signs budget for compliance tooling and who blocks deals. Output: buyer roles, decision criteria, legal/compliance concerns, procurement blockers, and what proof is required to approve paid pilots. Include source-backed evidence and explicit confidence scores.</code></pre>
        </article>

        <article class="card">
          <h3>Prompt 3: Pilot Outcome Metrics</h3>
          <pre><code>You are my startup diligence researcher. Define the most credible pilot outcome metrics for EU market-entry compliance workflow tools that only flag missing documents (no legal determinations). Include baseline capture methods, metric formulas, realistic improvement targets over 30-60 days, and anti-gaming safeguards. Provide references and confidence levels for each recommendation.</code></pre>
        </article>

        <article class="card">
          <h3>Prompt 4: Objection Intelligence</h3>
          <pre><code>You are my sales intelligence researcher. Identify top objections from APAC sellers evaluating EU compliance tooling and how top vendors handle them. Focus on objections around legal liability, false positives, integration effort, and ROI uncertainty. Output should include objection frequency if known, rebuttal strategy, supporting evidence, and confidence score.</code></pre>
        </article>

        <article class="card">
          <h3>Prompt 5: Expansion Triggers</h3>
          <pre><code>You are my market strategy researcher. After a successful Germany pilot, what is the highest-ROI expansion path: more German categories, more EU countries, or channel expansion beyond Amazon.de? Build a ranked expansion model with assumptions, source-backed signals, risk factors, and 90-day execution suggestions. Mark every modeled estimate clearly.</code></pre>
