        <h2>Core Problem</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Teams publish more AI-written product claims every week.</li>
          <li>Claims are often reviewed manually and too late.</li>
          <li>When unsupported claims go live, legal and brand risk increases.</li>
          <li>Most teams cannot prove claim origin and review logic quickly.</li>

        <h2>Cosmetics Enforcement Context (Why We Chose This Niche)</h2>
        <p>
          Your research highlights repeated enforcement patterns around pricing behavior,
          advertising claims, fake reviews, and substantiation quality. The key signal:
          fines can be material, and legal disputes can run for years.
