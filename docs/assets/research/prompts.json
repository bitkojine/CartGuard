Required output: 1) direct datasets that exist, 2) direct datasets that do not exist, 3) proxy stack with assumptions, 4) TAM/SAM/SOM ranges with confidence levels, 5) stage-safe claims vs non-stage-safe claims. For every number include value, unit, date, geography, source URL, and confidence. Prefer primary sources first (EU Commission, Eurostat, customs authorities, OECD, WTO, regulator docs)."
