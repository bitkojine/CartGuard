      "text": "You are my research analyst for CartGuard. Find benchmark ranges for paid B2B pilots in compliance workflow software. I need typical pilot length, paid pilot pricing ranges, pilot-to-annual conversion rates, and strongest predictors of conversion. For each metric include value/range, date, geography, source URL, and confidence level. Use primary or highly credible sources and explicitly mark missing direct data."

      "text": "You are my startup diligence researcher. Define the most credible pilot outcome metrics for a tool that flags missing documentation for APAC sellers entering EU marketplaces. We do recommendations only and no legal determinations. Output: metric definitions, formulas, baseline capture method, realistic 30-60 day target ranges, and anti-gaming checks. Include source-backed support with confidence scores."

Focus on objections around legal liability, false positives, integration effort, ROI uncertainty, and budget ownership. Output rebuttals, proof requirements, and confidence score for each objection pattern."

Required output: 1) direct datasets that exist, 2) direct datasets that do not exist, 3) proxy stack with assumptions, 4) TAM/SAM/SOM ranges with confidence levels, 5) stage-safe claims vs non-stage-safe claims. For every number include value, unit, date, geography, source URL, and confidence. Prefer primary sources first (EU Commission, Eurostat, customs authorities, OECD, WTO, regulator docs)."

Output: 1) buyer map by role, 2) trigger events for purchase, 3) current spend substitutes (agencies, legal, VAT/EPR tools, in-house), 4) realistic ACV ranges for pilot and annual contracts, 5) objections that block closing. Use source-backed evidence and explicit confidence scores. Mark assumptions clearly."

Required output: 1) competitor comparison table, 2) category leaders by segment, 3) where they can copy us fast, 4) where we can defend, 5) recommendation whether we are a new category or a feature in an existing category. Include only source-backed claims with confidence levels."

Build a practical target-account strategy for CartGuard in our first wedge: China-based Amazon.de consumer electronics sellers (10-100 staff, 500-5,000 SKUs). Output: 1) where to find these companies, 2) ranking criteria, 3) qualification checklist, 4) red flags for disqualification, 5) expected partner channels that can accelerate intros (agencies, VAT/EPR firms, integrators). Keep it execution-focused and avoid generic advice."

Output: 1) mandatory pilot metrics, 2) baseline data required before start, 3) success thresholds for go/no-go, 4) what claims become stage-safe after successful pilots, 5) kill criteria if pilots fail. Keep recommendations strict and measurable."
