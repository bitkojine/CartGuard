## One-Sentence Recommendation
Focus on China-based marketplace-first sellers in consumer electronics entering Germany, first clients are Amazon.de-focused brands with 500-5,000 SKUs, 10-100 staff, and at least one in-house ops/compliance lead.

## Verdict
Conditional Go: problem is real and growing, but buyer segment certainty, willingness to pay, and category position remain uncertain without focused wedge execution and 12-18 months of evidence.

## Top 3 Beachhead Options (Ranked)
1. China -> Germany, marketplace-first, consumer electronics.
2. China/India -> France, toys & childcare on marketplaces.
3. China -> Netherlands/Poland, home & living via marketplaces.

## Why Beachhead #1 Wins
- Germany is one of the strongest EU ecommerce markets and a high-volume entry destination.
- EU low-value parcel flow is massive, with China dominating origin share.
- Consumer electronics has recurring documentation burden and high enforcement relevance.
- Agency and partner ecosystem density is stronger for this corridor.

## First Customer Blueprint
- Origin: China (including HK where relevant)
- Destination: Germany
- Channel: Amazon.de-first
- Vertical: consumer electronics and accessories
- Company profile: 10-100 staff, 500-5,000 SKUs
- Team pattern: in-house ops/compliance owner + technical implementation support

## 90-Day Plan (Summary)
- Days 1-30: target list + partner outreach + design partner offers
- Days 31-60: implement Germany electronics rulepack v1 and capture baseline metrics
- Days 61-90: convert 1-2 pilots to paid contracts and publish first reference case

## Kill Criteria
If after 6-9 months this wedge has <3 integrated pilots, weak pilot conversion, and no measurable workflow impact, reposition to partner-layer model or pivot.
