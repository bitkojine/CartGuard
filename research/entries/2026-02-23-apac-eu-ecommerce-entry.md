## Boundary Note
This document is a draft synthesis. It includes several secondary sources and should be treated as working research until primary-source verification is completed.

## A) Executive Summary
- APAC SMEs increasingly export to the EU; one survey reports 76% had higher EU export volumes in the past year (2025).
- Europe cross-border ecommerce is estimated near USD 370B in 2024 (secondary market estimate).
- EU ecommerce turnover is reported at EUR 842B in 2024 (+7% YoY).
- EU low-value parcel flow remains massive: 4.6B in 2024, with 91% from China.
- Common non-EU seller gaps include missing Responsible Person/Authorized Representative, DoC, technical files, labeling, and VAT/IOSS setup.
- There is no single official count of mid-sized APAC ecommerce companies entering the EU each year.
- Proxy-based sizing is currently the most practical approach.

## B) What We Know / What We Don't Know

| Aspect | What we know | What we don't know |
|---|---|---|
| Market demand | APAC to EU flow is increasing based on survey and parcel/trade proxies. | Exact annual company count for mid-sized APAC entrants. |
| Target profiles | Marketplace-first sellers appear to show strongest documentation pain. | Clean segment-level delay and loss metrics by category. |
| Pain quantification | Missing documents and late review loops are recurring themes. | Share of launches delayed by each specific missing document type. |
| Regulatory/document differences | EU entry expectations often require explicit documentation artifacts. | Complete by-category APAC-home vs EU gap map with primary legal references. |
| Financial impact | Enforcement and delay/rework costs appear material in public reporting. | Reliable APAC-specific penalty and average delay cost dataset. |

## C) Stage-Safe Metrics Table (Working Draft)

| Metric | Value | Unit | Date/Year | Geography | Source | Confidence |

| APAC SMEs increasing EU exports | 76 | % of surveyed SMEs | 2025 | APAC->EU | https://rutair.com/news/fedex-76-percent-of-apac-smes-boost-exports-to-europe/ | Medium |
| Europe cross-border ecommerce market | ~370 | USD billions | 2024 | Europe | https://fulfilio.com/en/from-market-entry-to-scalable-growthhow-asian-brands-can-build-eu-ready-e-commerce-operations/ | Low-Medium |
| EU ecommerce B2C turnover | 842 | EUR billions | 2024 | EU | https://ecommerce-europe.eu/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/CMI2025_LIGHT_CORRIGENDUM.pdf | Medium |
| Low-value ecommerce parcels to EU | 4.6 | billions | 2024 | EU | https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/A-10-2025-0133_EN.html | High |
| China share of low-value parcels | 91 | % | 2024 | EU | https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/A-10-2025-0133_EN.html | High |

## D) Non-Stage-Safe Metrics (Need Validation)

| Metric | Value | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Chinese sellers on EU Amazon | 25% (2018) | Dated and likely shifted materially. |
| Global Amazon seller share from China | ~50% (2025) | Global proxy, not EU-specific. |
| Non-compliant imports metric | 13 per million | Requires primary methodological validation. |

## E) Customer Segment Map (Top 3 ICP Slices)
1. Marketplace-first APAC sellers entering EU marketplaces.
2. Hybrid D2C + marketplace teams with growing SKU complexity.
3. Early-stage teams with limited EU operational/legal infrastructure.

## F) Top Document/Evidence Gaps To Check First (v1)
- Responsible Person / Authorized Representative details.
- EC Declaration of Conformity (DoC), where applicable.
- Technical file artifacts (test reports, risk assessments).
- Product labeling requirements by market/language.
- VAT/IOSS registration and evidence for low-value consignments.

## G) Competitor Alternatives (Tool + Process + In-house)
- Tool stack: VAT/EPR tools and narrow checkers.
- Process stack: manual legal/consulting review.
- In-house stack: spreadsheets and custom scripts.

## H) 30-Day Validation Plan
- Week 1: Prioritize primary sources for every stage-safe metric.
- Week 2: Interview APAC target sellers on launch-delay root causes.
- Week 3: Validate top missing-document categories per target channel.
- Week 4: Publish v1 primary-validated metric pack and revise website claims.
