## Why This Entry Exists
Team asked for a simple operating model for paid pilots because paid pilot execution is now core to CartGuard growth.

## Working Definition
A paid pilot is a short paid engagement where we run CartGuard inside real customer workflow and prove measurable business results. It is not a free trial and not a legal determination service.

## Pilot Outcome Metrics (Core)
- Missing-document rate before publish.
- Median review time (draft to listing live).
- Rework loop count per listing.
- Pilot conversion to paid annual contract.

## Pilot Success Conditions
- Measurable improvement in at least two core metrics.
- A clear budget owner acknowledges value and agrees next scope.
- No unresolved critical integration blocker.

## Pilot Failure Conditions
- No measurable metric improvement.
- Customer uses output but still treats product as free checklist feature.
- No buyer ownership for post-pilot contract.

## Team Execution Notes
- Engineering owns instrumentation and integration reliability.
- Pilot lead owns cadence and decision logs.
- Sales owns buyer mapping and conversion path.
- Research agents own evidence quality and source verification.

## Source Notes
This entry is an operating playbook and includes both source-backed principles and modeled execution guidance. More primary benchmark data on pilot conversion norms should be added over time.
