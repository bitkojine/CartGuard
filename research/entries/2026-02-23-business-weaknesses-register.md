## Purpose
Keep a live list of what could break the business so team decisions stay grounded in evidence.

## Current Top Weaknesses
1. Limited proof of repeatable pilot-to-paid conversion.
2. Budget owner ambiguity between ops, compliance, agencies, and founders.
3. Integration load may be too heavy for mid-sized teams without implementation support.
4. Risk that buyers classify product as checklist feature instead of core workflow system.
5. Market size precision is still proxy-based, not from a direct dataset.

## Falsification Questions
1. What evidence would prove customers will not pay for this as standalone software?
2. What conversion result would invalidate the current wedge within 6 months?
3. Which competitor category can absorb this feature fastest?
4. Which metric can improve while customer value still remains low (false signal)?
5. Which single assumption, if false, makes the current roadmap wrong?

## 30-Day Team Use
- Review this register weekly in founder meeting.
- For each weakness, assign one owner and one evidence task.
- Promote closed questions to stage-safe claims only after source verification.
