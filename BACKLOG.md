# CartGuard Backlog

## Sales Backlog (Next 12 Hours)

Owner: Sales Lead
Objective: Convert market thesis into validated demand and at least one pilot path.

1. Finalize one-page pilot offer (ICP, use case, timeline, deliverables, success metrics).
2. Lock beachhead message: EU cosmetics ecommerce, build-time non-compliant claim blocking.
3. Build a target list of 20 EU accounts matching ICP.
4. Identify buyer contacts for each account (Engineering lead + Compliance/Legal lead).
5. Send 30-50 personalized outbound messages (email/LinkedIn).
6. Ask for a 20-minute problem-validation call (not a product demo).
7. Run a structured discovery script on every call.
8. Capture objections verbatim in a shared notes doc.
9. Propose a pilot scope to qualified prospects within 2 hours of each call.
10. Push for one concrete pilot commitment (paid preferred, free design partner acceptable).
11. Track funnel daily: contacted, replies, calls booked, qualified, pilot likelihood.
12. Report end-of-day outcomes to product/engineering for messaging and roadmap updates.

## Pilot Success Criteria Template

- Risk metric: % reduction in potentially non-compliant claims before publish.
- Speed metric: % reduction in manual compliance review time.
- Quality metric: false-positive rate threshold and override reasons.
